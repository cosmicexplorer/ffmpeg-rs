ffmpeg-sys
==========

A rust crate to wrap [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/documentation.html), natively or in the browser. A collaboration between [spack](https://github.com/spack/spack) and [emscripten](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/Tutorial.html).

This is the less interesting crate for most people though -- I instead recommend you check out [ffmpeg-rs](https://github.com/cosmicexplorer/ffmpeg-rs).

# TODO
- [ ] test with wasm-bindgen and cpal
- [ ] test with alsa
- [ ] upstream changes to spack
