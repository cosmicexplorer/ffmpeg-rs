ffmpeg-rs
=========

A rust crate to wrap [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/documentation.html), natively or in the browser. A collaboration between [spack](https://github.com/spack/spack) and [emscripten](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/Tutorial.html).

*Created for the purposes of [dmcaction](https://github.com/cosmicexplorer/dmcaction).*

Also see [symphonia](https://docs.rs/symphonia/latest/symphonia/), which also works great both natively and in the browser, but which doesn't have *en*coders for all its wonderful *de*coders!

# TODO
- [ ] test with wasm-bindgen and cpal
- [ ] test with alsa
- [ ] upstream changes to spack
